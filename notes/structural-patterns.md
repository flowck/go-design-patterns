# Structural Patterns

## The Adapter Pattern

This pattern enables the standardisation of structs' (classes') api through the creation of wrappers
that implement a standard interface.

## The Façade Pattern

This patterns enables the simplification of complex APIs from sub-systems by introducing an intermediate (the Façade) layer
that will take care of exposing the sub-system's APIs in a more comprehensive way.
