# Creational pattern

## Builder pattern

The Builder pattern, once applied correctly enables the separation of the construction of a complex struct (object)
from its representation, thus allowing multiple representations from the same construction process.

In the day-to-day activities of a programmer, the Builder pattern is particularly useful when a struct (object)
can be in a valid state with all or just some attributes.
